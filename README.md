# Task-03-Prodigy-InfoTech

## Project Overview

This project is part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Internship – Task 3** and focuses on analyzing a **marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The goal is to understand customer behavior and build a **Decision Tree classification model** to predict outcomes based on customer attributes.

The project covers the complete data science workflow—from loading and exploring data to preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and model building.
